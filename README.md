# Data_Computation_Mind
Cognitive Science Course at UofT (COG260) Labs

We explore how the human mind works by analyzing a range of data concerning such topics as human rationality and irrationality, human memory, how objects are represented in the mind, and the relation of language and cognition. This class provides critical thinking and practical computational skills that will allow students to work with data in cognitive science and related disciplines.

`Lab 2` explores **Weber's fraction**, which is the ratio of the just noticeable difference (see difference threshold) to the intensity of a stimulus.

`Lab 3` uses data obtained from Ganis & Kievit (2015), where 54 subjects performed a mental rotation task similar to Shepard & Metzler (1971): multiple pairs of 3D objects were presented at four different rotating angles. The goal is to **analyze the relationship between subjects' reaction times** (dependent variable) **and angles** (independent variable) both within subjects [Tasks 1-3] and across subjects [Tasks 4-5].

`Lab 6` explores the relationship between English word frequency and it's rank by extracting text from Ulysses. Through this lab, we re-visited **Zipf's law (1949) on the principle of least effort.** The principle laid out the lexicon trades off effort between speaker (who wants to say as few words possible, thus few words have high frequencies) and listener (who wants to hear as many words as possible, thus many words have low frequencies).
